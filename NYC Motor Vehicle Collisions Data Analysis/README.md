# Data-Engineering-and-Reporting

This Repository includes Data Engineering And Data Analysis projects which involved utilization of several On-premise database technologies like SQL, MySQL, PostgresSQL, DBeaver and Cloud Databases like Azure SQL, Azure Data Studio.
Undertaking these projects involved use of Google Big Query, Azure Data tools.
For all the Data preparation, profiling and ETL Jobs I have used Talend and Alteryx and SQL server for querying the Databases.
Finally projected the data using PowerBI and Tableau to gain useful and Data-decisions.
