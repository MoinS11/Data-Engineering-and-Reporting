Welcome to the Tokyo Olympics Data Engineering & Visualization repository! Here, I've delved into the fascinating world of the Tokyo 2021 Olympics data, which encapsulates comprehensive information about more than 11,000 athletes participating in 47 disciplines, representing 743 teams in the rescheduled 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

About the Dataset
The dataset encompasses a wide array of details, including athlete profiles, coach information, team participation, and gender-specific entries. It vividly portrays the participants' names, countries of representation, chosen disciplines, competitors' genders, and the identities of their coaches.

Data Processing Flow
The data journey began with fetching the dataset from the Tokyo Olympics GitHub HTTP API. This data was then seamlessly ingested into Azure Data Factory, offering a robust foundation for further processing. The Azure Data Factory efficiently stored this dataset into Data Lake Gen2 containers, setting the stage for subsequent transformations.

The transformation stage was carried out using Azure Databricks, harnessing its powerful capabilities to reshape the data into a more refined structure. Once the data was transformed, it found its new home within Data Lake Gen2, primed for advanced analytics.

Azure Synapse Analytics took the reins for the next phase, unleashing its potential for sophisticated data analysis on the Data Lake Database. This analytical process included the transformation of the data into a relational database format, enhancing its accessibility and utility.

Data Visualization
The culminating stage of this data journey involved harnessing the prowess of Power BI. This potent tool was employed to visually represent the insights derived from the Tokyo Olympics dataset. Through compelling visualizations, the data's intricate stories, trends, and narratives were brought to life, offering a rich experience for anyone keen on understanding the dynamics of the Tokyo Olympics.
